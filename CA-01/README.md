Exploratory Data Analysis: India Air Quality

Project Description:

This project utilizes Python to run an exploratory data analysis on India Air Quality. This dataset provides records that contain information for the following fields:
  - stn_code	
  - sampling_date	
  - state	
  - location	
  - agency	
  - type	
  - so2	
  - no2	
  - rspm	
  - spm	
  - location_monitoring_station	
  - pm2_5	
  - date

With this data and some data cleaning, an analysis can be run on the various areas of India as well as which parameters (so2, no2, rspm, spm) are affecting which states/locations in India as well as identify trends with the given historical data.

How to Install and Run Project:

First, download CA-01 zip file from GitHub. Unzip folder on local drive, then open Google Colab or any python notebook platform. Upload India_Air_Quality_CA_01.ipynb file in Colab or such platform and then upload data.csv file (file name must remain the same as it is mentioned and used in code). With these prerequisites done, the code can then be suyccessfully ran. Lastly, Python packages such as pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and scikit-learn must be installed.
