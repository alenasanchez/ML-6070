Logistic Regression

Project Description: 

In this project we utilize Python's Sklearn machine learning library, specifically, the Logistic Regression algorithm to develop a binary classifier model to predict CVD Risk. This program runs using CVD data containing 

How to Install and Run Project:

**This link and code below is crucial in running the program, as it used in the code**

url = "https://github.com/ArinB/CA05-B-Logistic-Regression/raw/master/cvd_data.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url, encoding = "ISO-8859-1") 

First, download CA-05 zip file from GitHub. Unzip folder on local drive, then open Google Colab. Upload AS_CA05.ipynb file in Colab. Once .ipynb file is open all cells will run without error. Ensure Python packages and functions listed below are installed:

- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- import pandas as pd
- import numpy as np
