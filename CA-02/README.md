# ML-6070: CA-02

Spam e-Mail Detection using Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm

Project Description: 

In this project we utuilize Python to develop and train a model with a set of emails that are labelled as either Spam or Not Spam. There is a total of 702 emails in the training dataset that are equally divided into these cataegories. This model is then tetsted with a set of 260 emails, which we will then ask the model to predict whether or not these emails are spam or not. Lastly, we will compare the accuracy of the results with the correct classifications.

How to Install and Run Project:

First, download CA-02 zip file from GitHub. Unzip folder on local drive, then open Google Colab. Upload AS_CA_02.ipynb file in Colab and then upload data.csv file (file name must remain the same as it is mentioned and used in code). With these prerequisites done, the code can then be suyccessfully ran. Lastly, Python packages and functions such as numpy, Counter, sklearn.naive_bayes, GaussianNB, sklearn.metrics, accuracy_score, and matplotlib are used in the program.
