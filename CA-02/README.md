Spam e-Mail Detection using Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm

Project Description: 

In this project we utuilize Python to develop and train a model with a set of emails that are labelled as either Spam or Not Spam. There is a total of 702 emails in the training dataset that are equally divided into these cataegories. This model is then tetsted with a set of 260 emails, which we will then ask the model to predict whether or not these emails are spam or not. Lastly, we will compare the accuracy of the results with the correct classifications. This program utilizes comments, prints, and visuals to show understanding of program and method utilized for e-mail classification.

How to Install and Run Project:

First, download CA-02 zip file from GitHub. Unzip folder on local drive, then open Google Colab. Upload AS_CA_02.ipynb file in Colab and then upload folder onto Google Drive! Once uploaded, in Model Development Section, you can put the path of your folder that calls for the testing and training data. (e.g. '/content/drive/MyDrive/MSBA-CA02-Spam-Mail-Naibe-Bayes-master/Data/train-mails'). Once path is configured, all cells will run with out error. Lastly, ensure Python packages and functions such as numpy, Counter, sklearn.naive_bayes, GaussianNB, sklearn.metrics, accuracy_score, and matplotlib are imported as they are used in the program.
